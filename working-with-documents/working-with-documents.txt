For example, a typical documentation set for some software application includes Release notes, Installation Guide, and a User Guide.

While releasing documents as part of a documentation set, you must:

* Maintain consistency among documents. For example, the components of the Introduction section must be same in all the documents of a documentation set.

* Ensure the version numbers match in all documents.

* Use the latest template. All the documents in the set must use the same template.

* Provide a reference to other documents in the set. This will help in structuring information and avoiding redundancy of information.
