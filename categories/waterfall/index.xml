      <description>Technical Writer (TW) receives a Vision and Scope document from QA/SME/Client. This could be in the form of a BRD, FRD, MRD, links to user stories and so on.
 QA/SME/Client arrange for a demonstration for the TW, as soon as a stable build of the product is available.
 TW creates the first draft of the required document. You must use Microsoft Word for creating source documents.
 At the time of releasing the draft, TW runs the document against the Microsoft Word Release Checklist.</description>
