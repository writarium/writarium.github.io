      <description>The section is an example. It starts with six DITA topics, which are then distributed into different combinations to produce different types of guides or outputs.
For example:
 The first ditamap organizes topics 1,2, and 3 into a web (HTML) deliverable. The second ditamap organizes topics 1, 3, and 5 into an epub. The third map organizes all six topics into a PDF deliverable.  This way DITA provides you with a method of reusing topic contents from different sources and combine them in a number of way to produce different outputs single sourcing.</description>
