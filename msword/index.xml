      <description>Creating an Index Professional Indexers recommend using a variety of keywords and synonyms to create indexes. However, index entries are based on topic titles only. This is due to limited project times. Moreover, every released book has several ways in which readers can look up information of interest, including the tables of contents, keyword searches, and indexes.
